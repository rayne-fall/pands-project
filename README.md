## Discussion

The *Iris* dataset (also known as Fisher's Iris dataset) is a dataset made famous by Fisher in his paper *The uses of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems*, published in September 1936<sup>1</sup>. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers and records their species, sepal length and width, and petal length and width. Originally collected by Anderson for his 1936 discussion<sup>2</sup> of the species problem<sup>3</sup>, Fisher used the dataset to demonstrate linear discriminant analysis<sup>4</sup>.

Existing discussions<sup>5</sup><sup>6</sup><sup>7</sup> of this dataset have noted its popularity in demonstrations of data analysis and use as a training dataset for machine learning, while others<sup>8</sup> have noted its lack of missing values and ties to eugenics research as reasons to move away from the use of *Iris* for these purposes.

Of the three species listed in the dataset, two had samples collected from the same colony (*Iris setosa* and *Iris versicolor*), while samples of the third (*Iris virginia*) were collected from a different colony. Fisher notes in Section VI of his paper that this "might considerably disturb both the mean values and their variabilities". Sharma<sup>5</sup>, panData<sup>6</sup> and Pandey<sup>7</sup> have all differentiated between these three species while carrying out their analyses, whereas for this analysis we've simply looked at the dataset as a whole.

We can see from the histograms generated by the analysis.py program that the values for sepal width and length each show an approximately normal distribution, while the values for petal width and length show a more varied distribution. We can also see from the scatter plots that there is a strong correlation between petal length and width, but hardly any correlation between sepal length and width. There is also a much stronger correlation between sepal length and both petal measurements than there is between sepal width and both petal measurements (although the correlation here is still stronger than the correlation between sepal width and length).

## Code

The aim of the analysis.py program is to produce an analysis of the *Iris* dataset. Currently, the program performs four functions:
    - Summarises each variable and outputs this summary to a .txt file.
    - Creates a histogram for each variable and saves them as .png files.
    - Creates a scatter plot (with line of best fit) of each pair of variables and saves them as .png files.
    - Calculates the correlation coefficient for each pair of variables and adds this to the aforementioned .txt file.

### Required Software

The code for the analysis.py program is written in Python, meaning you'll need to have Python installed to run it. I've used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) as the installer, with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the code editor, but you can use whatever you prefer. The *Iris* datset is included as a CSV file in this repository, but line 11 of the code can be modified to use a URL by inserting this into the pd.read_csv function in place of the iris.csv filename.
